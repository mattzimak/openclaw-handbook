# OpenClaw handbook

72 entries · last verified 2026-09-21 · 72 links checked · 0 dead

One founder's handbook for running a company with an OpenClaw agent: the setup choices I made and why, the security rules I keep, the skills I install, the memory patterns that stuck, and the people worth learning from. It is not a directory of everything that exists - if something is here, it earned its place in real work. The longer notes live in [FIELD-NOTES.md](FIELD-NOTES.md). Suggest a link by opening an issue (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

Descriptions are my own notes where I wrote one. Where I only saved a link, the description is the repository's or the post's own summary. Ratings like `(Matt: 8/10)` are my personal scores.

## Install and first week

The choices the installer asks you to make (model, channel, search, skills, package manager, hooks, Control UI) and how to survive the first week without breaking anything. My reasoning for each choice is in the notes.

- [If you installed OpenClaw this week, read this (r/clawdbot)](https://www.reddit.com/r/clawdbot/comments/1s270n0/if_you_installed_openclaw_this_week_read_this) - ShabzSparq's checklist after fixing 50+ OpenClaw setups, in order: switch the default model off Opus to Sonnet before the bill surprises you, bind the gateway to 127.0.0.1 and reach it over an SSH tunnel, read BOOTSTRAP.md and write a six-line SOUL.md before the first real task, and install no skills in week one because some loop silently and burn tokens. 559 upvotes, 64 comments.
- [OpenClaw setup guide: build your personal AI agent (Claire Vo, Lenny's Newsletter)](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/openclaw-the-complete-guide-to-building) - I built a team of 9 AI agents that run my work and life. Here's how you can too.

### Channel choice

My notes on this section: [Install and first week](FIELD-NOTES.md#install-and-first-week) (50 notes).

## Memory and context

How the agent remembers between sessions: the learnings-folder pattern, lossless context, memory plugins and what I still fight with.

- [Cognee](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee) - Open-source memory platform that builds a knowledge graph from your agent's data, with an official OpenClaw integration in its docs (via @KSimback's post) · 30k stars · Apache-2.0 · updated 2026-09

## Models and token burn

Which model runs what, how to switch, and how to stop the bill from growing: routers, token providers and the numbers I wrote down.

- [ClawRouter](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter) - Smart LLM routing to optimize token burn, if simple question = routing to cheap model, complex code - escalates to Opus or Sonnet. · 6.6k stars · MIT · updated 2026-09

The author still finds GPT 5.4 needs tighter steering than Opus 4.6, and prefers it that way.

### GPT 5.5

- [GPT 5.5: how to switch (Tak on X)](https://x.com/cherry_mx_reds/status/2047390468778901738) - if you're on latest openclaw just type: /models add openai-codex gpt-5.5 🦞🥔 if you're running into permissions issues running this then there are two ways to solve it. 👇 Do it yourself: send /whoami.

### Token providers

- [The Claw Bay](https://theclawbay.com) - Opus and Codex through one reseller key? (my open question) - their own pitch: one API key for GPT-6, Codex, Claude and Gemini access with low-latency EU and US routing.

My notes on this section: [Models and token burn](FIELD-NOTES.md#models-and-token-burn) (16 notes).

## Tools stack

What I connect the agent to and how far I let it go with each tool - Google, GitHub, web search, Linear, Obsidian, Manus.

My notes on this section: [Multi-agent and hierarchy](FIELD-NOTES.md#multi-agent-and-hierarchy) (9 notes).

## Prompts and collections

Prompt packs worth stealing from, the awesome-lists I go back to, and a few places that got me thinking about what an agent could earn.

### Prompts

- [Design Director Agent](https://x.com/kloss_xyz/status/2023142088850944283) - kloss's system prompt that replaces a design agency with OpenClaw: a Design Director agent that inherits Claude Code's frontend-design skill, extracts 30 to 50 scored references from designer accounts and sites you like, turns them into tokens and principles, spawns eight sub-agents (visual identity, UI and UX, design systems, motion, creative direction, layout and typography, design research,...

## Field notes

Working rules I keep in Notion and refine as OpenClaw changes - the anatomy of the workspace files, what not to do, SOUL.md, self-improvement, skill design.

Everything I wrote down, grouped by section, lives in [FIELD-NOTES.md](FIELD-NOTES.md):

## Other useful lists

This list is deliberately short and opinionated. When you want the exhaustive version, these are the ones I actually open:

- [alvinreal/awesome-openclaw](https://github.com/alvinreal/awesome-openclaw) - the reference directory for the OpenClaw ecosystem: official projects, dashboards, deployment tooling, memory systems, alternative clients, plugins and channel integrations. Several hundred entries against the seventy or so here, so start there when you are looking for a category rather than a recommendation.
- [alvinreal/awesome-openclaw-tips](https://github.com/alvinreal/awesome-openclaw-tips) - thirty numbered tips on messages, Telegram, memory, reliability, cost, operations, automation and architecture, each with the failure it prevents and a prompt you can paste. The closest thing to this repo's field notes written by someone else, and it covers ground mine does not.
- [VoltAgent/awesome-openclaw-skills](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-openclaw-skills) - 5,400+ skills filtered and categorised from the official registry. Use it as the index when you know the job you want done and need to find out whether a skill already exists.

The difference is intent, not quality: those are directories of what exists, this is a record of what I kept after using it. If a link appears in both, theirs will be more complete and mine will tell you whether it survived contact with real work.

## How this list is built

The source is a private Notion page where I keep notes while I work. A sync script in my workspace (`awesome-sync.py`, not in this repo) reads that page through the Notion API and keeps only the sections that are explicitly mapped as public - everything else stays private by default. It canonicalizes every URL (https only, tracking parameters dropped, `youtu.be` and `twitter.com` rewritten), drops links to private places (Notion, Google Drive, course platforms, local addresses), scans every string for secrets and private names, and writes three files: `data/links.csv` (one row per link), `data/notes.json` (the field notes) and `data/_report.md` (what was excluded and why).

From there everything is automated and reproducible from this repo alone:

- `tools/enrich.py` checks every link and writes `data/enrichment.json`: stars, license, last push and archive state from the GitHub API (renamed repositories are followed), titles from YouTube and X oEmbed, and a plain HTTP check with a browser user agent for everything else.
- `tools/build.py` renders this README and `FIELD-NOTES.md` from `data/` + `config/sections.json` + `templates/`. Links stay here, every note goes to the notes file, grouped by the same sections. Entries are sorted by name inside each section; the build is deterministic, so running it twice produces the same files.
- `tools/lint.py` fails on dead links, descriptions under 30 characters, duplicate names or URLs, non-https links, tracking parameters, links to private hosts, long dashes, placeholders, thin sections and broken table-of-contents anchors - in both files. Whatever it cannot fix on its own is listed under "Open decisions" in `data/_report.md`.
- A weekly GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/links.yml`) re-runs the checks and opens a pull request when either file changes. `data/_dead.md` lists what needs a human look.

Nothing in this README or in `FIELD-NOTES.md` is edited by hand. Fixes go to `data/overrides.json` (keyed by the entry id in `data/links.csv`, or by block id under `_notes` for a note) and the next build picks them up.

Current build: 72 entries in 12 sections, 157 field notes. Links checked: 72, dead: 0, last check: 2026-09-21. What the sync excluded and why is in `data/_report.md`. The field notes are rendered into `FIELD-NOTES.md` by the same build.
